[00:47.06]Don't get any big ideas
[00:58.38]They're not gonna happen
[01:07.57]♪
[01:14.26]You paint yourself white
[01:20.75]And fill up with noise
[01:26.33]But there'll be something missing
[01:35.47]♪
[01:40.44]Now that you found it
[01:46.60]It's gone
[01:51.58]Now that you feel it
[01:58.14]You don't
[02:03.09]You've gone off the rails
[02:10.62]♪
[02:16.84]So don't get any big ideas
[02:28.08]They're not gonna happen
[02:37.46]♪
[02:44.61]You'll go to Hell
[02:50.66]For what your dirty mind
[02:59.15]Is thinking
[03:08.26]♪
