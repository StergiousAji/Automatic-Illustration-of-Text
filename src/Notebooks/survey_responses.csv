Timestamp,How intuitive and easy to use did you find the application?,Did you encounter any problems whilst completing your task?,"Do you have any suggestions to improve the existing system?
(e.g. to resolve any encountered problems)",What features would you like to see added in the future?
20/02/2023 14:09:42,5,I did not encounter any problems whilst completing my tasks.,I don't have any suggestions as I did not face any problems.,An option to listen to the lyrics being sang instead of just being able to read them.
21/02/2023 13:29:58,4,Not really,I think just to have a loading screen with an estimated time to completion. Just to have feedback that the site hasn't crashed.,"Share on social media (Facebook, instagram, tiktok, youtube etc)"
21/02/2023 14:17:38,4,Photos were not always relevant.,A simple tutorial page for selecting photos would have been good.,Refresh/generate new set of images for a lyric chunk.
21/02/2023 15:34:26,5,clicking a link twice in succession sometimes caused an error,idk,"perhaps a way of being able to see and select more images based on a similarity to a specific image. e.g. if there is one good image from the initial selection, clicking on it may show more images similar to that one (while not necessarily being similar to the prompt), that may be selected"
22/02/2023 13:45:18,5,No problems on my side ,Nope,Use a YouTube api rather to select a video rather than pasting the url
01/03/2023 18:44:34,4,"Sometimes the images recommended were not relevant to the text, this seemed due to the ambiguous nature of the text however ","Where the overall rating of a line appears ambiguous, potentially take high probability images from each of the words or just the keywords which make up the line, I.e for “when I got home” take images from home and I and when  , maybe showing 2/3 from each. Instead of showing 10 produced from the ambiguous entire line  ","None, seems like a pretty cool system "
13/03/2023 13:23:06,4,Clicking links during the loading of pages caused unhelpful errors,A separate loading screen could help with the issue so that I cannot interact with any links,"Instead of only generating videos from audio, add a feature so that it can work with text too. The generated video could also read aloud the text."
13/03/2023 13:32:49,4,"Images were not always relevant, in very rare cases I felt that no images were relevant",Allow some way to expand the list when there is very little images that are relevant,Nope
13/03/2023 13:36:14,5,None,The application worked perfectly,"Since I am not fluent in German, I repeatedly had to translate the chunk text to English using Google Translate. Add some kind of API that allows translating to my native language on the application."
13/03/2023 13:51:16,4,"Once I got to the page with the images, I didn't know how to get back to the previous page showing the song lyrics. It was only later that I found out that the song title was a link",Make the link back more clearly or as a separate button,Add some way to navigate to other chunks once on the page with the images. Maybe use show an interactable timeline of the audio to go to different parts of the song.
13/03/2023 13:56:18,4,I ran into an error when I clicked the Submit button twice on the home page,don't allow the user to click on buttons when the page is loading,"The Build Ground Truth button should take me to the last edited chunk, instead it currently takes me to the first chunk unless I finish"
13/03/2023 14:03:55,4,I wasn't sure what it meant by URL as I tried submitting a link that I got by right clicking on a YouTube video but this was considered invalid. I required help for this part.,You could try integrating the YouTube search into the system so I don't have to find the URL of the video.,see previous answer
13/03/2023 14:07:38,5,No problems at all,"None, the system is quite intuitive","Sometimes the text within specific chunks didn't have a clear meaning like ""oh oh"" so it was confusing which images to select. If I could listen to the specific chunk, I may be able to determine the mood of the line to help me."
13/03/2023 14:09:49,5,No issues from my side,Works great currently,"I'm not sure, the system already covers what I need to complete the task"
13/03/2023 14:22:47,5,I didn't encounter any problems,No suggestions as I was able to complete my task without problems,Add a progress bar since loading the first chunk took several seconds so a an estimated time would really help. Also when submitting the YouTube URL.
13/03/2023 14:28:57,4,"Yes, I clicked on the Submit button more than once and it caused an error page to show",Fix this bug or show a more informative error message because the page was very unhelpful,"No additional features required, I was able to complete the task successfully after getting past the error."
