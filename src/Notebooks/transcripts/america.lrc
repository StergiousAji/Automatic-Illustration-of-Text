[00:07.36]On the first part of the journey
[00:11.13]I was looking at all the life
[00:14.65]There were plants and birds and rocks and things
[00:18.60]There was sand and hills and rings
[00:23.08]The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
[00:26.45]And the sky with no clouds
[00:30.59]The heat was hot and the ground was dry
[00:34.03]But the air was full of sound
[00:38.09]I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
[00:41.51]It felt good to be out of the rain
[00:45.66]In the desert you can remember your name
[00:49.35]'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[00:53.97]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[01:01.72]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[01:08.76]After two days in the desert sun
[01:12.63]My skin began to turn red
[01:16.42]After three days in the desert fun
[01:20.05]I was looking at a river bed
[01:23.90]And the story it told of a river that flowed
[01:27.71]Made me sad to think it was dead
[01:31.31]You see
[01:32.13]I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
[01:35.43]It felt good to be out of the rain
[01:39.59]In the desert you can remember your name
[01:43.18]Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[01:47.48]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[01:55.16]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[02:01.72]♪
[02:16.80]And after nine days I let the horse run free
[02:21.24]'Cause the desert had turned to sea
[02:24.85]There were plants and birds and rocks and things
[02:28.46]There was sand and hills and rings
[02:32.39]The ocean is a desert with its life underground
[02:36.09]And a perfect disguise above
[02:39.60]Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
[02:43.60]But the humans will give no love
[02:47.36]You see
[02:47.95]I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
[02:51.50]It felt good to be out of the rain
[02:55.30]In the desert you can remember your name
[02:58.93]'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[03:02.81]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:10.56]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:17.89]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:26.37]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:33.19]♪
