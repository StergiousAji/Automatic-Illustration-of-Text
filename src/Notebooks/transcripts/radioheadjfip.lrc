[length:04:09]
[00:57.71]Just as you take my hand
[01:00.54]Just as you write my number down
[01:03.52]Just as the drinks arrive
[01:06.41]Just as they play your favorite song
[01:09.36]As your blather disappears
[01:12.16]No longer wound up like a spring
[01:15.25]Before you've had too much
[01:18.01]Come back in focus again
[01:21.07]The walls are bending shape
[01:23.82]They got a cheshire cat grin
[01:26.79]All blurring into one
[01:29.73]This place is on a mission
[01:32.62]Before the night owl
[01:35.57]Before the animal noises
[01:38.79]Closed circuit cameras
[01:41.50]Before you're comatose
[01:45.78]♪
[02:07.61]Before you run away from me
[02:10.42]Before you're lost between the notes
[02:13.43]The beat goes round and round
[02:16.10]The beat goes round and round
[02:19.40]I never really got there
[02:22.16]I just pretended that I had
[02:25.06]Words are blunt instruments
[02:27.95]Words are sawed off shotguns
[02:30.81]Come on and let it out
[02:33.77]Come on and let it out
[02:36.71]Come on and let it out
[02:39.63]Come on and let it out
[02:42.54]Before you run away from me
[02:45.44]Before you're lost between the notes
[02:48.31]Just as you take the mic
[02:51.35]Just as you dance, dance, dance
[02:56.14]♪
[03:11.58]Jigsaw falling into place
[03:14.23]So there is nothing to explain
[03:17.16]Regard each other as you pass
[03:20.05]She looks back, you look back
[03:23.19]Not just once
[03:26.12]Not just twice
[03:29.06]Wish away nightmare
[03:31.87]Wish away nightmare
[03:34.55]You got a light you can feel it on your back
[03:37.56]A light you can feel it on your back
[03:40.70]Jigsaw falling into place
[03:46.55]♪
