[length:04:09]
[00:58.45]Just as you take my hand
[01:00.68]Just as you write my number down
[01:03.59]Just as the drinks arrive
[01:05.96]Just as they play your favorite song
[01:09.55]As your blather disappears
[01:11.85]No longer wound up like a spring
[01:14.95]Before you've had too much
[01:18.05]Come back in focus again
[01:20.99]The walls are bending shape
[01:23.64]They got a cheshire cat grin
[01:26.72]All blurring into one
[01:29.67]This place is on a mission
[01:32.13]Before the night owl
[01:35.33]Before the animal noises
[01:38.84]Closed circuit cameras
[01:40.96]Before you're comatose
[02:07.97]Before you run away from me
[02:10.40]Before you're lost between the notes
[02:13.68]The beat goes round and round
[02:16.02]The beat goes round and round
[02:19.12]I never really got there
[02:21.69]I just pretended that I had
[02:25.39]Words are blunt instruments
[02:27.60]Words are sawed off shotguns
[02:30.80]Come on and let it out
[02:33.37]Come on and let it out
[02:36.73]Come on and let it out
[02:39.57]Come on and let it out
[02:42.92]Before you run away from me
[02:44.96]Before you're lost between the notes
[02:48.55]Just as you take the mic
[02:50.88]Just as you dance, dance, dance
[03:11.78]Jigsaw falling into place
[03:14.37]So there is nothing to explain
[03:17.17]Regard each other as you pass
[03:19.97]She looks back, you look back
[03:22.93]Not just once
[03:26.12]Not just twice
[03:28.76]Wish away nightmare
[03:31.85]Wish away nightmare
[03:34.68]You got a light you can feel it on your back
[03:37.55]A light you can feel it on your back
[03:40.50]Jigsaw falling into place
