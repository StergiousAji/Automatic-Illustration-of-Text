[00:05.93]Day off in Kyoto
[00:08.15]Got bored at the temple
[00:09.74]Looked around at the 7-Eleven
[00:13.38]The band took the speed train
[00:15.53]Went to the arcade
[00:17.12]I wanted to go, but I didn't
[00:20.34]You called me from a payphone
[00:22.80]They still got payphones
[00:24.78]It cost a dollar a minute
[00:27.67]To tell me you're getting sober
[00:29.92]And you wrote me a letter
[00:32.33]But I don't have to read it
[00:36.92]I'm gonna kill you
[00:41.61]If you don't beat me to it
[00:43.99]Dreaming through Tokyo skies
[00:50.71]I wanted to see the world
[00:56.13]Then I flew over the ocean
[00:58.87]And I changed my mind (woo)
[01:10.10]♪
[01:22.95]Sunset's been a freak show
[01:25.22]On the weekend, so
[01:27.02]I've been driving out to the suburbs
[01:30.38]To park at the Goodwill
[01:32.49]And stare at the chemtrails
[01:34.80]With my little brother
[01:37.63]He said you called on his birthday
[01:39.56]You were off by like ten days
[01:41.56]But you get a few points for tryin'
[01:44.59]Remember getting the truck fixed
[01:46.92]When you let us drive it
[01:49.18]Twenty-five felt like flying
[01:55.48]I don't forgive you
[02:00.36]But please don't hold me to it
[02:02.73]Born under Scorpio skies
[02:09.63]I wanted to see the world
[02:14.94]Through your eyes until it happened
[02:18.18]Then I changed my mind
[02:25.46]♪
[02:27.85]Guess I lied
[02:35.19]I'm a liar
[02:42.58]Who lies
[02:49.43]'Cause I'm a liar
[02:54.10]♪
