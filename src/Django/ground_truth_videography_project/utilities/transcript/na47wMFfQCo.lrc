[00:07.77]On the first part of the journey
[00:10.70]I was looking at all the life
[00:14.75]There were plants and birds and rocks and things
[00:19.34]There was sand and hills and rings
[00:24.15]The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
[00:26.88]And the sky with no clouds
[00:30.48]The heat was hot and the ground was dry
[00:34.54]But the air was full of sound
[00:38.57]I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
[00:42.17]It felt good to be out of the rain
[00:46.18]In the desert you can remember your name
[00:49.74]'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[00:53.73]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[01:02.08]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[01:09.46]After two days in the desert sun
[01:12.53]My skin began to turn red
[01:16.88]After three days in the desert fun
[01:20.82]I was looking at a river bed
[01:24.56]And the story it told of a river that flowed
[01:28.41]Made me sad to think it was dead
[01:32.38]You see
[01:33.83]I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
[01:36.87]It felt good to be out of the rain
[01:40.77]In the desert you can remember your name
[01:44.71]Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[01:48.49]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[01:56.53]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[02:03.07]♪
[02:19.32]And after nine days I let the horse run free
[02:22.78]'Cause the desert had turned to sea
[02:26.62]There were plants and birds and rocks and things
[02:29.94]There was sand and hills and rings
[02:33.94]The ocean is a desert with its life underground
[02:38.23]And a perfect disguise above
[02:42.09]Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
[02:45.99]But the humans will give no love
[02:49.69]You see
[02:50.57]I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
[02:53.36]It felt good to be out of the rain
[02:57.24]In the desert you can remember your name
[03:01.55]'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[03:04.85]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:13.13]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:21.18]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:28.48]La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[03:33.50]♪
