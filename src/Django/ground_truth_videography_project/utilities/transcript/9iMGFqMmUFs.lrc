[00:06.50]Water is virtually everywhere,
[00:08.81]from soil moisture and ice caps,
[00:11.26]to the cells inside our own bodies.
[00:14.09]Depending on factors like location,
[00:16.18]fat index,
[00:17.40]age,
[00:18.11]and sex,
[00:19.20]the average human is between 55-60% water.
[00:23.81]At birth, human babies are even wetter.
[00:27.02]Being 75% water, they are swimmingly similar to fish.
[00:32.31]But their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday.
[00:37.33]So what role does water play in our bodies,
[00:40.20]and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy?
[00:44.29]The H20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints,
[00:48.53]regulate temperature,
[00:49.95]and to nourish the brain and spinal cord.
[00:53.93]Water isn't only in our blood.
[00:56.06]An adult's brain and heart are almost three quarters water.
[01:00.51]That's roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana.
[01:04.37]Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%.
[01:08.49]And even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water.
[01:14.31]If we are essentially made of water,
[01:16.05]and surrounded by water,
[01:17.63]why do we still need to drink so much?
[01:20.49]Well, each day we lose two to three liters through our sweat,
[01:24.29]urine,
[01:25.23]and bowel movements,
[01:26.71]and even just from breathing.
[01:28.37]While these functions are essential to our survival,
[01:30.86]we need to compensate for the fluid loss.
[01:33.31]Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration
[01:37.85]or over-hydration,
[01:39.71]both of which can have devastating effects on overall health.
[01:43.28]At first detection of low water levels,
[01:45.40]sensory receptors in the brain's hypothalamus
[01:48.37]signal the release of antidiuretic hormone.
[01:51.40]When it reached the kidneys, it creates aquaporins,
[01:54.49]special channels that enable blood to absorb and retain more water,
[02:00.44]leading to concentrated, dark urine.
[02:03.05]Increased dehydration can cause notable drops in energy,
[02:06.56]mood,
[02:07.59]skin moisture,
[02:08.77]and blood pressure,
[02:10.20]as well as signs of cognitive impairment.
[02:13.25]A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amount
[02:17.21]as a normal brain,
[02:18.70]and it even temporarily shrinks because of its lack of water.
[02:22.62]Over-hydration, or hyponatremia,
[02:25.61]is usually caused by overconsumption of water in a short amount of time.
[02:30.67]Athletes are often the victims of over-hydration
[02:33.24]because of complications in regulating water levels
[02:36.59]in extreme physical conditions.
[02:39.26]Whereas the dehydrated brain amps up the production of antidiuretic hormone,
[02:43.77]the over-hydrated brain slows, or even stops, releasing it into the blood.
[02:49.17]Sodium electrolytes in the body become diluted,
[02:51.98]causing cells to swell.
[02:54.13]In severe cases,
[02:55.58]the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting volumes of dilute urine.
[02:59.77]Water intoxication then occurs,
[03:01.92]possibly causing headache,
[03:03.56]vomiting,
[03:04.69]and, in rare instances, seizures or death.
[03:08.16]But that's a pretty extreme situation.
[03:10.29]On a normal, day-to-day basis,
[03:12.06]maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to manage
[03:15.63]for those of us fortunate enough to have access to clean drinking water.
[03:19.53]For a long time, conventional wisdom said that we should drink eight glasses a day.
[03:23.81]That estimate has since been fine-tuned.
[03:26.45]Now, the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe
[03:30.25]depends largely on our weight and environment.
[03:33.12]The recommended daily intake varies from between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men,
[03:39.62]and about 2-2.7 liters for women,
[03:42.80]a range that is pushed up or down if we are healthy,
[03:46.15]active,
[03:46.99]old,
[03:47.95]or overheating.
[03:49.66]While water is the healthiest hydrator,
[03:51.52]other beverages,
[03:52.62]even those with caffeine like coffee or tea,
[03:55.23]replenish fluids as well.
[03:57.32]And water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H20 intake.
[04:02.31]Fruits and vegetables like strawberries,
[04:04.33]cucumbers,
[04:05.30]and even broccoli are over 90% water,
[04:08.87]and can supplement liquid intake while providing valuable nutrients and fiber.
[04:14.12]Drinking well might also have various long-term benefits.
[04:17.28]Studies have shown that optimal hydration can lower the chance of stroke,
[04:21.62]help manage diabetes,
[04:23.11]and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of cancer.
[04:27.87]No matter what, getting the right amount of liquid makes a world of difference
[04:32.05]in how you'll feel,
[04:33.34]think,
[04:34.20]and function day to day.
