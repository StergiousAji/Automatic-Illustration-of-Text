[00:04.66]One day you'll look
[00:07.98]To see I've gone
[00:10.97]For tomorrow may rain
[00:13.72]So I'll follow the sun
[00:18.43]Some day you'll know
[00:22.07]I was the one
[00:25.16]But tomorrow may rain
[00:27.94]So I'll follow the sun
[00:31.56]And now the time has come
[00:34.01]And so, my love, I must go
[00:38.47]And though I lose a friend
[00:41.08]In the end, you will know, oh
[00:45.01]♪
[00:47.26]One day you'll find
[00:51.05]That I have gone

[01:11.18]So I'll follow the sun
[01:14.64]And now the time has come
[01:17.29]And so, my love, I must go
[01:21.43]And though I lose a friend
[01:24.88]In the end, you will know, oh
[01:30.51]One day you'll find
[01:34.36]That I have gone
[01:37.15]But tomorrow may rain
[01:40.16]So I'll follow the sun
