[00:00.28]Diamonds are forever
[00:04.38]They won't leave in the night
[00:06.96]I've no fear that they might
[00:10.18]Desert me
[00:15.07]Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
[00:17.23]Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
[00:19.91]Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
[00:22.26]The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
[00:25.44]Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[00:29.38]Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[00:33.86]Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
[00:36.49]Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
[00:39.83]And I've realized that I've arrived
[00:42.08]'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
[00:44.53]"Does he write his own rhymes?" Well, sort of, I think 'em
[00:47.28]That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
[00:49.76]"Damn, is he really that caught up?"
[00:51.44]I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
[00:54.88]I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
[00:57.68]Or even a four-track recorder
[00:59.56]So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
[01:02.87]Spoil yourself, that's important
[01:04.66]If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
[01:07.16]Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
[01:10.06]Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
[01:12.02]I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because-
[01:14.60]Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
[01:16.54]Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
[01:19.35]Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
[01:21.55]The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
[01:24.68]Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[01:28.73]Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[01:33.63]I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
[01:36.65]Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
[01:39.10]Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
[01:41.19]30 minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
[01:43.58]What more could you ask for? The international asshole
[01:46.92]Who complain about what he is owed?
[01:48.83]And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
[01:51.22]You gotta love it though, somebody still speaks from his soul
[01:53.72]And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
[01:56.29]When he came in the game, he made his own lane
[01:58.82]Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
[02:01.13]It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say "Kayne"
[02:03.68]Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
[02:06.25]Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
[02:08.72]Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
[02:11.32]Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
[02:13.79]My father been said I need Jesus
[02:15.59]So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
[02:18.60]The preacher said we need leaders
[02:20.43]Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
[02:23.56]You know who you call, you got a message, then leave it
[02:26.07]The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
[02:28.60]Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
[02:30.92]Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
[02:33.49]After debris settles and the dust get swept off
[02:36.08]Big K pick up where young Hov left off
[02:38.47]Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
[02:40.84]I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
[02:43.43]A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up"
[02:45.84]Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
[02:48.37]Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
[02:50.75]In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
[02:53.29]People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
[02:55.78]That'll be the same day I give the game back
[02:58.24]You know the next question, dog, "Yo, where Dame at?"
[03:00.66]This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
[03:03.11]"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
[03:05.68]They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
[03:08.49]But r-r-r-right here stands a man
[03:10.32]With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
