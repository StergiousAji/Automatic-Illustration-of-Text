[00:28.97]I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand
[00:34.26]Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
[00:40.15]Lose sensations, spare the insults leave them for another day
[00:45.63]I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away
[00:51.00]♪
[01:24.85]It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand
[01:30.54]On the tenth floor, down the backstairs into no man's land
[01:36.20]Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
[01:41.76]I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow
[01:46.65]♪
[02:20.97]What means to you, what means to me and we will meet again
[02:26.41]I'm watching you, I watch it all, I take no pity from your friends

[02:37.95]Until the spirit, new sensation takes hold, then you know
[02:43.72]'Til the spirit, new sensation takes hold, then you know
[02:49.43]'Til the spirit, new sensation takes hold, then you know
[02:57.01]I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
[03:02.67]I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
[03:08.79]Feeling, feeling
[03:10.29]Feeling, feeling
[03:12.10]Feeling, feeling
[03:13.63]Feeling
[03:16.14]♪
