[00:25.65]A heart that's full up like a landfill
[00:35.22]A job that slowly kills you
[00:41.51]Bruises that won't heal
[00:48.37]♪
[00:51.62]You look so tired, unhappy
[00:57.69]Bring down the government
[01:04.17]They don't, they don't speak for us
[01:14.41]♪
[01:16.75]I'll take a quiet life
[01:22.34]A handshake of carbon monoxide
[01:28.91]No alarms and no surprises
[01:35.25]No alarms and no surprises
[01:41.30]No alarms and no surprises
[01:47.68]Silent
[01:54.06]Silent
[02:00.88]This is my final fit

[02:34.43]♪
[02:56.06]Such a pretty house
[03:01.71]And such a pretty garden
